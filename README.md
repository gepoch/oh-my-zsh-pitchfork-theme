# Pitchfork
## Arm the mobs of oh-my-zsh

This is an extendable powerful oh-my-zsh theme, that is slowly becoming a system in its own right.

Currently, this is recognizable as a simple oh-my-zsh theme.

Going forward, this will begin to support more "Prongs" as I integrate it with other cool, well-written oh-my-zsh plugins.

Here's what's currently possible

╭hostname▹ working_directory directory stack contents
├──git───▹ branch_tag_or_ref current repository status
├──svn───▹ subversion_repo_path
├──env───▹ python_virtualenvironment_name
╰────────▸ 

Depends on the oh-my-zsh (virtualenv)[https://github.com/gepoch/oh-my-zsh-virtualenv] and (dirstack)[https://github.com/gepoch/oh-my-zsh-dirstack] plugins.
